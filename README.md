ANNOUNCEMENT
======================
As I don't need this library for now, I stop maintaining it for a while. Please, use a prolific
version as they are actively develop it.

Here is the [prolific maitained version](https://github.com/prolificinteractive/material-calendarview).

I will archive this repository for now, and will unarchive it when I will have time to develop this library.

Calendar View 2
======================

[![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/ptrstovka/maven/calendarview2/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/ptrstovka/maven/calendarview2/_latestVersion)[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ptrstovka/calendarview2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ptrstovka/calendarview2)

This is improved Material CalendarView from [Prolific Interactive](https://github.com/prolificinteractive/material-calendarview). My version 2+ has some breaking changes to the core, so the API is not backward compatible with prolific version.

Customization
-------------

One of the aims of this library is to be customizable. The many options include:

* [Define the view's width and height in terms of tile size](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#tile-size)
* [Single or Multiple date selection, or disabling selection entirely](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#date-selection)
* [Showing dates from other months or those out of range](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#showing-other-dates)
* [Setting the first day of the week](docs/CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#first-day-of-the-week)
* [Show only a range of dates](docs/CUSTOMIZATION_BUILDER.md#date-ranges)
* [Customize the top bar](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#topbar-options)
* [Custom labels for the header, weekdays, or individual days](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md#custom-labels)


### Events, Highlighting, Custom Selectors, and More!

All of this and more can be done via the decorator api. Please check out the [decorator documentation](docs/DECORATORS.md).

### Custom Selectors and Colors

If you provide custom drawables or colors, you'll want to make sure they respond to state.
Check out the [documentation for custom states](docs/CUSTOM_SELECTORS.md).
